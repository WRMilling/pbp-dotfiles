# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles which will eventually target OS X, Linux, and WSL.

## Installation

On OS X:  
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WRMilling/dotfiles/master/.scripts/setupMac.sh | sh -`

On Linux/WSL:  
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WRMilling/dotfiles/master/.scripts/setupLinux.sh | sh -`

## Fonts

The font has to be manually selected in iTerm2 right now, at least until I take a moment to figure out how to automate that. Font selection is located in `Preferences > Profiles > Text > Change Font`.
